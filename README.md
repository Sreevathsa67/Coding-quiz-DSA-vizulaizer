💻 CodeLearn: Visual DSA Learning Platform✨ Master Data Structures & Algorithms VisuallyCodeLearn is an interactive educational platform designed to help you master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through visual concepts, hands-on coding challenges, and real-time progress tracking.🚀 Key FeaturesVisual DSA Learning 📊Interactive Visualization: See complex data structures (like Linked Lists, Graphs, Stacks, etc.) and their operations (Insert, Delete, Traverse) animated in real-time.Conceptual Clarity: Bridge the gap between theory and practice by observing the step-by-step execution of algorithms and data structure manipulations.Data structures available: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.AI-Powered Coding Quiz 🤖Unique Question Generation: Our platform uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create fresh, unique coding questions based on various DSA topics.Difficulty Levels: Practice across different difficulty tiers:Easy: For foundational concepts.Medium: To build problem-solving skills.Hard: For advanced challenge and interview preparation.In-built Coding Environment: Solve problems directly on the platform with a dedicated code editor, test cases, and immediate feedback on submissions.Gamified Progress Tracking 📈Personalized Dashboard: View your overall performance, including Active Users, Total Questions, Submissions, and Success Rate.Skills Breakdown: Get a detailed analysis of your proficiency in different DSA topics (e.g., Arrays, Linked Lists, Sorting, Dynamic Programming).Learning Streak & Achievements: Stay motivated with tracking for your current and best Learning Streak (e.g., 7-Day Streak) and unlock Achievements based on your progress.Submission History: Review your recent submissions, including success status, score, and time spent.🖼️ Visual ShowcaseFeatureDescriptionScreenshotVisual DSA LearningInteractive view of a Linked List and its operations.Graph VisualizationVisual representation of a Graph data structure with nodes and edges.Coding QuizHard problem page with a description, constraints, and an in-built Python code editor.DashboardOverview of user metrics, quick actions, and learning progress over time.Skills BreakdownDetailed progress bars showing mastery percentage for various data structures and algorithms.🛠️ Technologies Used(Placeholder: List the main programming languages, frameworks, and libraries used in your project here, e.g., React, Node.js, Python for AI, MongoDB, D3.js for visualization, etc.)🤝 ContributingWe welcome contributions!
