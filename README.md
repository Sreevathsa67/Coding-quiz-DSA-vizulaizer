## üöÄ Core Features

### 1. ü§ñ AI-Generated Coding Quizzes
* **Unique Questions:** Our platform utilizes **AI** to dynamically create fresh, unique coding questions, ensuring a vast and ever-expanding practice library.
* **Difficulty Tiers:** Challenge yourself with problems across three defined levels:
    * **Easy:** Build your foundational knowledge.
    * **Medium:** Sharpen your core DSA problem-solving skills (e.g., *Reverse Trees Problem*).
    * **Hard:** Tackle complex, interview-level questions (e.g., *Reverse Stacks Problem*, *Find Pair Sum in Stacks*).
* **In-Browser IDE:** Solve problems directly on the platform with a built-in code editor, run code, and submit your solutions for immediate testing and feedback.

### 2. üìä Visual DSA Learning (Visualizing)
* **Interactive Demonstrations:** Visualize complex **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** in real-time. See exactly how operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal work step-by-step.
* **Key Data Structures Visualized:**
    * **Linked Lists:** See node manipulation and traversal.
    * **Stacks:** Observe LIFO operations clearly.
    * **Graphs:** Explore nodes, edges, and traversal techniques.

### 3. üìà Real-time Progress Tracking
* **Personalized Dashboard:** Get a quick overview of your progress with key metrics like **Total Score (e.g., 1,250)**, **Total Submissions**, and **Success Rate (e.g., 85%)**.
* **Skills Breakdown:** Track your mastery across core DSA topics:
    * Arrays (e.g., 85% mastery)
    * Linked Lists (e.g., 72% mastery)
    * Trees (e.g., 68% mastery)
    * Sorting (e.g., 90% mastery)
    * Dynamic Programming (e.g., 45% mastery)
* **Gamification:** Stay motivated by tracking your **Learning Streak** and unlocking **Achievements** (e.g., *7-Day Streak*, *First Solution*).
